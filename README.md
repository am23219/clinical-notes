# Clinical Notes Summarizer & Insights Extractor

A Python microservice that helps make sense of medical notes by converting unstructured clinical text into structured JSON with summaries and extracted medical entities. Built with FastAPI and Azure OpenAI.

## What it does

This tool takes messy clinical notes and:
- Creates clear, concise summaries that capture the key points
- Extracts structured data like medications, diagnoses, procedures
- Returns everything in a clean JSON format that's easy to work with

The result is clinical data that's much easier to navigate, search, and analyze.
